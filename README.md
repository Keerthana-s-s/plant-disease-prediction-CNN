**Plant Disease System for Sustainable Agriculture**



**Problem Statement**
•	Develop a CNN-based model capable of detecting and classifying plant diseases from images of leaves of various crops such as apple, cherry, grape, and corn. 
•	The model should accurately identify both healthy and diseased leaves while predicting the specific type of disease. 
•	This system will aid in precision agriculture by enabling early detection and effective disease management.



**Proposed problem solution **
•	To design and implement a CNN-based model that accurately detects and classifies plant diseases from leaf images, identifying both healthy and diseased conditions. 
•	The system aims to support precision agriculture by enabling early diagnosis and improving crop management practices.
